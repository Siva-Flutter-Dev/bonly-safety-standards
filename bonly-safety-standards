Bonly App – Child Safety and CSAE Standards

Last updated: 08 November 2025

Bonly is committed to maintaining a safe and respectful platform for all users. We have zero tolerance for any content or behavior involving child sexual abuse or exploitation (CSAE).

Our Standards:

Bonly does not permit any content, imagery, or communication that exploits or endangers children.

We actively remove any content that violates these standards.

We promptly report suspected CSAE content to appropriate regional or national authorities, including law enforcement and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), as required by law.

Users can report any child safety concerns through the app or by contacting us directly.

Reporting Concerns:
If you encounter any content or user behavior that may involve child exploitation or endangerment, please contact us immediately at siva.flutter.dev@gmail.com
.

Compliance:
Bonly complies with all relevant child safety and data protection laws. Our moderation systems are designed to prevent, detect, and act upon any CSAE-related activity within the app.
